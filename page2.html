  <h1 class="header">Spring Time!</h1>

  <p style="line-height:1.5"class="italic">Spring is the time when nature awakes. Everything is fresh and alive and new.<br>
  Below, we have listed some of the most prominent, basic colors of spring.<br>
This is also represented in the colors that can now be found in nature. <br>
Opposed to the dull, cold, gray and white shades of winter, spring comes with a fresh and vibrant palette.</p>
<div class="container">
      <ul>
          <li><a href="#section1">Fresh Green</a>
          <li><a href="#section2">Soft Pink</a>
          <li><a href="#section3">Warm Yellow</a>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="section1">Fresh Green </h2>
      <p>
          Green must be <span style="font-weight:bold;">THE color of spring</span>. Spring is the time when everything comes back to life after a long winter slumber. Nature rejuvenates, the snow melts and everwhere fresh green pops up. Naturally, we thus associate green with the vernal season.
      <p>
          There is no particular flower related to this color as each flower, tree, and bush starts into springtime with fresh green leaves. Thus, all kinds of plants, from apple trees to blades of grass, cover nature with a fresh and new green shade.

      <h2 id="section2">Soft Pink </h2>
      <p>
          One of spring’s softer and gentler colors is pink. It can be found either speckled around cities or meadows during springtime or covering whole parks and streets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latter is largely due to the blossoms of the cherry tree. With their rich and soft pink and myriad of blossoms per twig or branch, they are able to paint whole blocks and avenues. They are not the only flowers or plants responsible for the soft pink hue of spring though. Peonies and camellia flowers blossom during spring and add to the slightly pinkish scenery.

      <h2 id="section3">Warm Yellow </h2>
      <p>
          Yellow is a warm and friendly color. The one “item” it is most associated with is, of course, the sun. During spring, it almost seems like the sun changes its light from a cold white to a warm and glowy yellow. Yellow is the brightest color of the spectrum and the lightest color perceivable by the human eye.
      </p>
      <p>
          But not only the sun adds a yellow tint to our environment during spring. Many flowers blooming speckle and lavish nature with almost golden accents. Around Easter, especially daffodils can be seen in flower beds and decorations anywhere. Buttercups and freesias are also among the most prominent flowers blooming in spring.
