        <h3>Today</h3>
        <p><strong>By Billy Collins</strong></p>
        <p>If ever there were a spring day so perfect,<br>
        so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze</p>

        <p>that it made you want to throw<br>
        open all the windows in the house</p>

        <p>and unlatch the door to the canary&#39;s cage,<br>
        indeed, rip the little door from its jamb,</p>

        <p>a day when the cool brick paths<br>
        and the garden bursting with peonies</p>

        <p>seemed so etched in sunlight<br>
        that you felt like taking</p>

        <p>a hammer to the glass paperweight<br>
        on the living room end table,</p>

        <p>releasing the inhabitants<br>
        from their snow-covered cottage</p>

        <p>so they could walk out,<br>
        holding hands and squinting</p>

        <p>into this larger dome of blue and white,<br>
        well, today is just that kind of day.</p>

        <h3>Lines Written in Early Spring</h3>

        <p><strong>By William Wordworth</strong></p>

      <p>I heard a thousand blended notes,<br>
      While in a grove I sate reclined,<br>
      In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts<br>
      Bring sad thoughts to the mind.</p>

      <p>To her fair works did Nature link<br>
      The human soul that through me ran;<br>
      And much it grieved my heart to think<br>
      What man has made of man.</p>

      <p>Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,<br>
      The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;<br>
      And &rsquo;tis my faith that every flower<br>
      Enjoys the air it breathes.</p>

      <p>The birds around me hopped and played,<br>
      Their thoughts I cannot measure:&mdash;<br>
      But the least motion which they made<br>
      It seemed a thrill of pleasure.</p>

      <p>The budding twigs spread out their fan,<br>
      To catch the breezy air;<br>
      And I must think, do all I can,<br>
      That there was pleasure there.</p>

      <p>If this belief from heaven be sent,<br>
      If such be Nature&rsquo;s holy plan,<br>
      Have I not reason to lament<br>
      What man has made of man?</p>
