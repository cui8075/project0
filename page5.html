                <h2>Spring: Margot Standing in a Garden <br> (Fillette dans un jardin)</h2><br><span style="font-size:20px;color:grey;">1900</span> <br>
                Creator:<span style="font-weight:bold;">Mary Cassatt</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                  <p>This is one of the many studies of young girls Cassatt painted around the turn of the century. Margot Lux, a child from the village near Cassatt’s country home, was the model, as she was for almost fifty works by the artist, including "Young Mother Sewing" (29.100.48). Both paintings typify Cassatt’s mature Impressionist style, featuring simplified compositions, a high-keyed palette, and bravura brushstrokes. That Margot is portrayed with her dress sliding off her tiny shoulder suggests that the artist captured her in a fleeting instant, perhaps during a pause in play.</p>

                Creator:<span style="font-weight:bold;">Vincent van Gogh</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                  <p>In technique, Fishing in Spring is a testament to Vincent van Gogh’s friendship with Paul Signac. Van Gogh had seen works by Signac and Georges Seurat in the spring of 1886 at the final Impressionist exhibition. Signac was an eloquent spokesman for Seurat’s pioneering Neo-Impressionism, explaining it as a natural development of Impressionism. Under Signac’s influence, Van Gogh’s palette brightened, his brushstrokes became more varied, and his subject matter expanded. The setting of this work is the Seine River at the Pont de Clichy, near Asnières, where Van Gogh and Signac painted together on several occasions.</p>
